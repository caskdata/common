CDAP Common: CLI

Introduction
============

The CLI module contains a Command-Line Interface (CLI) framework for building your own CLI
complete with auto-completion and command-parsing.

Usage
=====

To use this CLI framework, you must first define a command::

  public class EchoCommand implements Command {

    @Override
    public void execute(Arguments arguments, PrintStream output) throws Exception {
      output.println(arguments.get("some-input"));
    }

    @Override
    public String getPattern() {
      return "echo <some-input>";
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
      return "Echoes whatever is passed";
    }

  }

This will define a command that would match the user input ``echo something``, for
example. In ``execute()``, ``arguments.get("some-input")`` would then return
``something``, because ``something`` was matched to ``<some-input>`` from the
``getPattern()`` implementation. You can then instantiate a ``CLI`` instance and have it
use your command::

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    CLI cli = new CLI<Command>(new EchoCommand());
    cli.run(args, System.out);
  }

If args is empty, then the ``CLI`` will start in interactive mode. This will provide a
shell (similar to bash) from which the user can enter in multiple commands and use
auto-completion.

If args is not empty, then the ``CLI`` will assume the args are the parts of a command,
and execute the command. In this example, if args is ``["echo", "hello"]``, then the
``CLI`` will match the input to the ``EchoCommand`` command and pass ``"hello"`` as the
argument value for the ``"some-input"`` argument.

Examples
========

* `HelloCLI <src/main/java/io/cdap/common/cli/examples/HelloCLI.java>`__: the simple
  example presented above 
* `NoteCLI <src/main/java/io/cdap/common/cli/examples/NoteCLI.java>`__: notetaking CLI that
  demonstrates usage of multiple commands and completers
